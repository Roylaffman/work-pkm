Yo! Not a huge priority, more of an FYI. You'll have to reach out to Noah to get the contract information for the last couple CCA's. I had a meeting with tanner yesterday to gather all the minimum attributes for each CCA and tried requesting a contract link. He noted that it would need to be derived from Noah or Legal.

## Promt
Natalie Questions:  
[@Jeremy Rangel](mailto:JRangel@Selectwater.com), [@Ryan Lafferty](mailto:RLafferty@selectwater.com), were the changes that Noah are referring to been implemented?

Once Jeremy and Ryan confirm that the changes were implemented, they can provide you with the tabular file.

The CCA Audit Dashboard was created for audit purposes, not for long term. I have kept it active because Mike needed access to it and he shared the link with Chris and John. The options for the dashboard are the following:

- Deprecate dashboard as planned in the projec6t scope
- Keep dashboard active, no further changes are implemented
- Keep dashboard active, proposed changes are documented and evaluated based on LOE and team allocation

The Service Desk request template has been developed and reviewed by the team. Please get with Ryan and Jeremy to go over the workflow.

[@Ryan Lafferty](mailto:RLafferty@selectwater.com), please work with Noah to generate the calculations. ( Friday) 
## Response
we have created a Template for BD to fill out

This folder contains the **CCA Submission Template**  where BD will enter the attributes and the newest Print out of the CCA FC Table, **Select CCA Production**

'Let me know where this should live in production' *note for later *

Noah and I will meet Friday to conclude Calculations - Making sure the most complex area - The area where MTDR and PR overlap in Lea County is checked and counted correctly with all shapes/geometries.



# Calc

![[PR Ded and ROFR.png]]


Go through the Permian Resource and MTDR Rows in Lea county with Noah

1. Create workbook for calculations
2. CCA Calc cheat sheet
3. PR is Produced and Frac Dedication 
	1. Produced and Freac ROFR - All fluid types
4. 

## Noah
Calculate All Permian Resources by individual rows

Click on each of the shapes, show me how we're calculating each shape by hand, and what it looks like. Give me the row totals by fluid type / dedication 

Also do the Matador Raptor/Dagger calculation, and show how the totals change across the two
