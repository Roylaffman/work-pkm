### Nick Requests

##### **Summary: Matador Roberne Riser Issues**
SD: [Request Details - Select Water Solutions](https://selectwatersolutions.sdpondemand.manageengine.com/app/itdesk/ui/requests/208025000006429053/details?selectTab=requestDetails&woFrom=ActivitiesList)
**From:** (Unspecified sender, likely internal Select Water team)  
**To:** Ricci Susong and team

The discussion focuses on confusion around the **Deep Purple Riser** and **Matador Roberne tie-in points**. The **Deep Purple Riser**—shown in a referenced photo—appears to have **no available ports** for the Roberne pipeline connection. There may be another port on the opposite side, or the team could potentially use **booster pump tie-ins** if that station is no longer active.

During a **site visit by Survey and Environmental teams**, the **Deep Purple Riser could not be located**, and **Matador has not yet constructed their riser** at the **north tie-in point**.  
The assumption had been that the riser was located about **150 feet southwest** of the area in question, but field findings conflict with that.

The sender attached **four KMZ files** and **two photo links** for review:

- **From Hector:** Two risers located close together (Pins: _Riser 1 – Larger Riser_ and _Riser 2_)
    
- **From Tyler (LT Survey):** One pin labeled _Select Riser_, appearing to reference the larger riser.
    

The sender is requesting **confirmation on the correct tie-in location** so that the **survey can be finalized** and the **BLM permit amended** accordingly.

### **Tasks to Complete**

1. **Confirm the correct riser/tie-in point** for the Roberne pipeline connection.
    
    - Verify whether the “Deep Purple Riser” is indeed one of the two risers identified by Hector or the single riser noted by LT Survey.
        
2. **Review attached KMZs and linked photos** to assess riser locations and confirm alignment.
    
3. **Communicate with Matador** to confirm whether their riser at the north tie-in has been constructed.
    
4. **Update and finalize the survey route** based on the confirmed tie-in.
    
5. **Amend the BLM permit** to reflect the correct tie-in point once confirmed.
