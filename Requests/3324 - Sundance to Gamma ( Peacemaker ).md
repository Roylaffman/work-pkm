**Subject:** ## 3324 ## GIS-GIS Data-Modifications to Existing GIS Data-Select Pipeline Updates-Sundance to Gamma

Good afternoon,

I was hoping to get clarification on this reroute(in green). I understand that this route(formerly Peacemaker)  should be updated with a name change to Sundance to Gamma, but I would like confirmation that the highlighted route is what should be updated with the reroute. A second route to the Southwest of the reroute(in green) is also named Peacemaker (fig 2) and I just wanted to ensure I was updating the correct route.
