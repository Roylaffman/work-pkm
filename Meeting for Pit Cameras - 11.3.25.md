### 🧭 **Main Discussion Points**

**1. Map Requirements**

- Nate explained that teams in the field need **easy-to-use reference maps**, since they often lack internet access.
    
- These would be **PDF maps**, not necessarily printed — just something they can **open offline**.
    
- Each map would include:
    
    - A **Google Earth image background** for visual reference.
        
    - An **“X” marking** where to place the camera.
        
    - The **azimuth (direction)** the camera should face.
        
- The maps are meant to function like a **“treasure map”**, providing visual simplicity for field crews.
    

**2. Scale of Work**

- Nate emphasized that **maps are not needed for every pit** — likely just **around 12**.
    
- The final number depends on whether the project moves forward after cost estimates are reviewed.
    

**3. Workflow and Data Integration**

- Natalie confirmed that her team can **automate the map creation** using **data-driven pages** (ArcGIS Pro functionality).
    
- She suggested that once approved, they could also:
    
    - Set up **Field Maps** for direct data updates from the field.
        
    - Capture if a camera’s position changes from the proposed to an actual location.
        
    - Store **camera details** as part of that workflow.
        

**4. Project Status and Next Steps**

- Nate said the current focus is to **estimate project costs** before committing.
    
- Once they have approval, he’ll submit a **refined request** for mapping and field data setup.
    
- Natalie agreed to **close the current request** until they hear back.

### 💬 **Key Takeaways**

- The project is **on hold** pending cost and scope approval.
    
- The mapping solution will likely start small (≈12 pits).
    
- Once approved, GIS can produce maps efficiently and optionally integrate **Field Maps** for ongoing updates.
